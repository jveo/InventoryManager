# Shoe Inventory Manager
This simple application keeps track of inventory of shoes.
It has a form on the front end where users can add new shoes into the database,
a view items page where all inventory of shoes are displayed in a table, and this software also
includes a pie chart where users can view the most popular types of shoes.

### Getting Started
Once the user has logged in, they can insert new shoes into the database by filling
out the form on the 'Add Items' tab. Each shoe has four different
properties: type, brand, size and shoe condition. On the 'View Items' page
users can see all the items in the database and remove items by selecting it and clicking the remove button.

### Prerequisites
